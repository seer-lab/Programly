There are 3 downloads for Gentle Forest, depending on how much money you spend on it.
The free download has the tileset in 3 colors, plus any additional files (like the tree wall).
The $5 and $10 downloads have 3 and 4 more color palettes, respectively.

Here are the names of the color palettes:

$0 (free) download
These are all inspired by levels from Seiken Densetsu 3.
	v01 "rabite forest"
	v02 "jungle of illusion"
	v03 "moonlight forest"

$5 download
These are original palettes by yours truly (Seliel the Shaper)
	v04 "crystal"
	v05 "sulfur"
	v06 "redwood"

$10 download
These are also my original palettes, but these are inspired by my seasonal forest collection.
You can find those here (they are much more robust tilesets): https://itch.io/s/33657/-forest-of-seasons-bundle
	v07 "spring"
	v08 "summer"
	v09 "autumn"
	v10 "winter"
